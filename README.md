Hi! I'm Jatin Mittal and this is my advanced Java-based mathematical calculator , a versatile tool for performing a wide range of mathematical operations and solving various mathematical problems. It provides the following functions:

1. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Remainder for basic arithmetic operations.

2. Power (a^b) for exponentiation.

3. Under-root (a^(b/c)) for calculating roots and fractional powers.

4. Factorial (a) for solving factorial expressions.

5. Log Value (In(a)) for natural logarithms.

6. Log Value with Base 10 (log(a)) for logarithms with base 10.

7. Trigonometric Values (sin, cos, tan) for solving trigonometric functions.

8. Table of a Number for generating multiplication tables.

9. HCF/GCD of 2 Numbers for finding the highest common factor.

10. LCM of 2 Numbers for calculating the least common multiple.

11. Geometry Problems for solving area and volume of various geometric figures, including:
    
     i) Cuboid
    
     ii) Cube
    
    iii) Hollow Cylinder (Pipe)
    
    iv) Cone
    
    v) Sphere
    
    vi) Hemisphere

    This calculator provides a comprehensive set of mathematical tools, making it a valuable resource for a wide range of mathematical calculations and problem-solving in various fields.
